Pet Registry App

This repository contains the source code for a Pet Registry App, consisting of a Symfony backend and a Vue.js frontend.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine: 
        ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/pet-registry-app.git```

Navigate to the directory
        ```cd docupet-test-assesssment```

Build and run the Docker containers:

```docker-compose up --build```

This command will build the images and start the containers for both the Symfony backend and Vue.js frontend.

Access the applications:

    Symfony backend: http://localhost:8000
    Vue.js frontend: http://localhost:8080
                        
    Main links: 
        1. http://localhost:8080 -> Generic Pet Form
        2. http://localhsot:8080/vuetify-pet-form -> Vuetify Pet Form
                        

The Vue.js frontend depends on the Symfony backend, so ensure the backend is up and running before accessing the frontend.

Stop the containers when you're done, you can stop the containers by running:
    ```docker-compose down```

Additional Information

    Symfony Backend: The Symfony backend is accessible at http://localhost:8000. You can explore and interact with the API endpoints.
